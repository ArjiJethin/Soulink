Today I learned/tested how to structure hackathon themes effectively and noticed how small design tweaks make a big difference in presentation quality. The best part of my day was brainstorming creative website elements, while I think I could improve on managing my breaks to avoid late-night fatigue tomorrow. I am grateful for a productive study session, good conversations with friends, and fresh ideas for my projects. My plan for tomorrow is to focus on finishing one prototype and polishing my event plan, and ensure I rest well by sleeping at 11:30 PM. My mind feels clear and slightly reflective as I prepare to sleep.",
